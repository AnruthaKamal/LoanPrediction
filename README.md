Loan Prediction
This repository contains a Streamlit-based web application that provides a simple and convenient way for debtors to monitor the status of their loans. The application uses the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to handle class imbalance and implements a thorough process of feature engineering to identify the most important features. The Random Forest Classifier is selected as the best performing model to predict loan approval, with an accuracy score of 0.78.
