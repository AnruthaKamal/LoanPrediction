# Loan Prediction

A Streamlit-based web application to predict loan approval status. Utilizing Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to handle class imbalance, feature engineering to identify key features, and a Random Forest Classifier to achieve an accuracy score of 0.78.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following libraries installed in order to run the code:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- imblearn
- scikit-learn

### Installing

Clone the repository to your local machine:
$ git clone https://github.com/AnruthaKamal/LoanPrediction.git

Navigate to the project directory and install the required libraries:
$ cd LoanPrediction
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

### Running the Application

To run the Streamlit-based web application, simply run the following command:
$ streamlit run app.py


The application should now be running on your local machine, and you can interact with it in your web browser.
